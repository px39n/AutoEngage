# AutoEngage
 
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a Python library that can recognize and evaluate levels of engagement in given images.

----------------------------

## Specific Requirements and Goals
Data Integration and Cleaning: The library should be able to integrate and clean raw data. This includes the handling of missing or incomplete data, detection and handling of outliers, and normalization of image data.

Frame-based Training on Videos: The library should utilize existing libraries to implement frame-based training on videos. This means the system should be capable of breaking down video input into individual frames and use these frames as training data for our models.

Evaluation of Results: The system should include functionalities for evaluating the performance of the engagement detection. This can involve metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).

## Scope of Work
Data Integration and Cleaning

The system should accept various formats of image data as input.
It should be capable of detecting and handling missing or incomplete data.
The system should handle detection and treatment of outliers in the dataset.
Implement image normalization to ensure consistency across the dataset.
Frame-based Training on Videos

The library should be able to break down video input into individual frames.
It should utilize existing Python libraries for the frame-based training process.
The system should employ deep learning techniques for training on this data.
Evaluation of Results

The system should allow for evaluation of its own performance.
It should use statistical measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) for this purpose.
The library should be able to provide a detailed report of its performance metrics.
Please note that this document serves as a high-level overview of the requirements and goals, and more detailed specifications should be developed as the project progresses.
